1) Radius of the zone in units of one solar radius
2) Temperature in units of 10^6 deg (K)
3) Logarithm (to the base 10) of the electron density in units of
   cm^{-3}/N_A, where N_A is the Avogadro number
4) Mass of the zone with the given radius in units of one solar mass 
5) X(^7Be): beryllium-7 mass fraction
   [For special purposes, it is useful to know the 7^Be mass fraction.]
6) Fraction of pp neutrinos produced in the zone 
7) Fraction of boron 8 neutrinos produced in the zone
8) Fraction of nitrogen 13 neutrinos produced in the zone
9) Fraction of oxygen 15 neutrinos produced in the zone
10) Fraction of florine 17 neutrinos produced in the zone
11) Fraction of beryllium 7 neutrinos produced in the zone
12) Fraction of pep neutrinos produced in the zone
13) Fraction of hep neutrinos produced in the zone
