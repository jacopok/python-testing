# python-testing
This is where all my experiments with python go. I'm mainly trying out the scientific libraries: numpy, scipy, sympy, astropy...

In the folder `numerical-methods` there are exercises for a course in numerical methods for astronomy.

Otherwise, in no specific order there are small code projects done either for a university class or for fun.

A couple of recent interesting ones: 

- `sounds_of_spectra/converter.py` converts the energies of the spectral series of Hydrogen to notes (by shifting down by several octaves), in the same folder one can find a Musescore score and an `mp3` synthesized version of it.
- `spectral_line_finder.py` takes an observed spectrum of a certain unknown ion and queries the Nist database of spectral lines to guess what ion it is.
- `fractals/mandelbrot.py` generates fractals (despite the name, also Julia fractals, not just the Mandelbrot set). A sample render is `fractals/pictures/high_res_plasma.pdf`.
- `Bayes vs frequentist.ipynb` does the simulation from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rwtDBhD6Mq0).
