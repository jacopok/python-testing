# python-testing
This is where all my experiments with python go. I'm mainly trying out the scientific libraries: numpy, scipy, sympy...

Most of the projects here will not work, many of them are abandoned or only half-finished.
If I have linked you to something here, however, I should have polished it at least to the point of not immediately giving errors. If I have not, please scold me.
